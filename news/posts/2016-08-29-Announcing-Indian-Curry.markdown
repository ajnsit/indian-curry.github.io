Although functional programming has been around since the beginning of
computer science, it is seeing a renaissance recently. While the
academic community is seeing an explosion of activities, many
industrial organisations are embracing the functional programming
paradigm. We are a group of functional programming enthusiasts who
believe there is a lot of potential in the growth of functional
programming in both the industry and in the academic institutions of
India. Our aim is to:

1. Improve the collaboration between the functional programming
   community in India.

2. Encourage the adoption of functional programming and related formal
   techniques in the Indian industry.

3. Build a functional programming eco-system within the country by
   building close cooperation between the industry and academia.
